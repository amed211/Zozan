# Zozan
This program prevents hackers from executing code remotely on your device. THIS IS ONLY A BETA VERSION

This program is an improved iteration of the beta version, and active development is ongoing. If you have any questions, please send them to mobil.uygulama.404@gmail.com. It's compiled using x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ and Mono, but Visual Studio is also an option for compilation. THE PROGRAM HAS TRANSITIONED FROM OPEN SOURCE TO CLOSED SOURCE. If you wish, you can also check out older versions in the releases section. This program is still under development...

Zozan.exe blocks code execution on your device. (There are some advanced bypass methods, but I will close all of them.)

Zozan2DG.exe encrypts a private folder containing your data with strong AES encryption, allowing only you, with the password, to access these files. Even if a hacker steals the data, it remains fully encrypted, and no one without the password can view it. (There are some shortcomings, which I'm currently working on.)

WARNING: The encryption algorithm isn't working as intended yet; do not use it outside of test purposes. The program is a beta version and still has deficiencies and bugs. All encryption errors are due to the OK.zoz file. DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY THE FILE.

Zozan2DG.exe has been modified in accordance with feedback. A loading screen will now appear during the encryption and decryption phases.
