# Zozan
This program prevents hackers from executing code remotely on your device. THIS IS ONLY A BETA VERSION

This prevents remote command execution on your computer. The program was compiled using x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++; those who prefer can use Visual Studio. A ready-to-use .exe file is also available.

The compilation command for the program is:
x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ main.cpp ProcessWatcher.cpp ProcessController.cpp AlertSystem.cpp WhitelistManager.cpp -o zozan.exe -static
